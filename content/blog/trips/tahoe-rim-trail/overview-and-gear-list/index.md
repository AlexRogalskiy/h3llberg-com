The [Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT)](https://tahoerimtrail.org/) was my first long-distance solo hike. The trail covers 165 miles around Lake Tahoe. What makes the TRT a great option for a first thru-hike is that it's a loop. That makes logistics easier: you end your hike where you begin it. It also offers numerous bailout points along the trail in case something were to go wrong.

I had to split my hike in two parts because of work. The first part was from Tahoe City to Kingsbury South. I would then go back to work for two weeks before completing the trip together with my cousin.

## Gear list

Most of the gear I had for the hike were already tried and true, with the exception of my brand new [Zpacks Duplex](http://www.zpacks.com/shelter/duplex.shtml). I had ordered the tent almost 7 weeks earlier, and had already mentally given up on getting it before the hike. At last, they shipped the tent and I got it a couple of days before heading out.

I wanted to go light, but still make sure I had everything I needed to stay safe and reasonably comfortable.

## Food

It would take me 5 days from Tahoe City to Kingsbury South, which was the end of the first leg of the trail for me. The first and last days were only half days, so I only needed half the amount of food those days.

I accounted for 2 boils per day: one for morning coffee and one for a warm dinner.

Without going into a ton of details, my basic "meal plan" was:

**Breakfast**\
Granola with whole milk powder, freeze drided fruits or berries, and Starbucks Via coffee.

**Lunch**\
Street tacos filled with string cheese, pepperoni, and almond butter (for dessert, not mixed together).

**Snacks**\
Haribo gummy bears, Snickers, trail mix. Mio sport and energy for both electrolytes and boil-free caffeine.

I split my food up into separate bags per day to make it easier on the trail.

That's it, time to hit the trail!
