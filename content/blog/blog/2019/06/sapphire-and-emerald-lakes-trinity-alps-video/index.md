One thing I wanted to try out on my [trip to the Trinity Alps](/blog/2019/06/sapphire-and-emerald-lakes-trinity-alps) was recording a trip video. You can find the route description and gear list in the previous blog post if you are interested.

I used my iPhone to record all the video and edited it using iMovie. I had a small foldable tripod for holding the phone and used the built-in microphones for audio.
