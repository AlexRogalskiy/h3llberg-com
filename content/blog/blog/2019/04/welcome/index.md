Hey there!

I set up this blog to have a place to document my different outdoor adventures and to share my thoughts on things like trails and gear.

I initially wanted to set up a simple blogging solution based on an existing platform like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) so I wouldn't spend too much time tinkering with the site, instead of being able to spend that time on writing content.

I wasn't able to find a blogging platform that gave me the features and performance I wanted, so I ended up building my own with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

So here we are, a couple of weeks later. I ended up spending a lot of time tinkering with the site instead of writing content, just as I feared. But I'm also happy with the end result.

I'm not a designer by any stretch of the imagination, so instead, I focused on building the site simple, lightweight, and fast – the same principles I like to follow when hiking.

## So what's the plan?

Now that I have the blog up and running, I'm planning on finishing up a few trip reports from last year before starting on this year's planning. This means there will be a bunch of blog posts dated last year showing up over the coming weeks.

This year, I'm planning to hike the legendary [John Muir Trail](http://johnmuirtrail.org/) in late July, and in September a 5-day adventure trip organized by [Andrew Skurka](https://andrewskurka.com/) in the Rocky Mountain National Park. And although it's still far out, I've started planning a bikepacking trip in Patagonia next winter. Exciting times ahead!
